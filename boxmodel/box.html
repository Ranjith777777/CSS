        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, also known as MS Dhoni or Captain Cool, is one of the greatest cricketers in India. He
            was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand. Dhoni is famous for his calm attitude, excellent
            wicketkeeping, and powerful batting style. Under his captaincy, India won the T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC
            Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the Champions Trophy in 2013, making him the only captain to win all three
            ICC trophies. He also led Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to several IPL titles. Dhoni is admired for his
            leadership, hard work, and the ability to stay cool under pressure, which makes him a true legend of
            cricket.</p>
